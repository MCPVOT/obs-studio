"""Unity groups follow BUILD.md.

    uv run python -m unittest ci/test_build_groups.py

- Every implementation file (foo.c.h, foo.cpp.hpp, foo.m.h, foo.mm.hpp) is
  in a group, so it can't drop out of the unity build.
- A file is in one group per build: it may be in several groups only when
  each is for a different host (the per-host no-op groups).
- A group file holds comments, its precompiled header (first, a
  <name>.pch.h/.pch.hpp next to it), then includes of existing implementation
  files of its own language, in alphabetical order.
- Every implementation file in a group includes exactly one header: the
  group's precompiled header. Anything else it needs is in that header, so the
  PCH is the whole of what each file depends on. Exceptions, both after the
  code starts: a host file including the no-op capability headers it builds
  (obs-host/noop/*.hpp, #1051), and an X-macro table (a header without
  #pragma once or an include guard) included as data.
