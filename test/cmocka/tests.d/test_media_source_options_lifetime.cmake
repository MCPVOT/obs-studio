# FFmpeg media playback reads the source-owned options on its worker thread.
# Wrap FFmpeg's parser in this headless test to pause that read while the
# caller releases its settings string, wrap bfree to count releases of the
# option strings, and wrap pthread_join to hold the read until the worker is
# joined. No libobs test hook is needed.
# Under LeakSanitizer the full-decode cases also reach the AVPacket that
# mp_media_next_packet leaves behind on a read error or EOF (media.c), so this
# test only exits clean under sanitizers once that leak is fixed.
